document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // The visual timer display has been removed from the HTML.
    // No JavaScript is needed to update it.
    // The backend still uses the hidden '#start-time' input (if present)
    // to calculate the duration when the form is submitted.

    // You could add other non-timer related JavaScript here if needed in the future.

    // Example: Log to console to confirm JS loaded (optional)
    // console.log("Game JS loaded. Visual timer disabled.");
